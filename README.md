# ServerlessWebApp

These files are used to host the serverless web application using AWS services mentioned in my resume. 

I replaced any personal info and credentials with "XXXXXX...." (At least 3 X's) .If you plan on using these, make sure to check and replace all "XXXXXXXX..." with appropriate values. 

Also don't forget to use your own "resume.png".
